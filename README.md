# UCM-MATH140-Logistic-Regression-Prediction

## Descriptions
I used this project as a practice project to build everything from scratch to develop a logistic regression model in Matlab. The project advanced my comprehensive understanding of the underlying principle of optimization method and statistical analysis method and honed my coding skills in Matlab

## Project Details
- Based on the objective function including logistic regression model and regularization, derived its gradient and hessian
- Applied Gradient Descent and Newton's Method to optimize the parameter of the objective function to minimize the objective function's value
- Substituted the computed parameters back to the logistic regression model and obtained probability as output
- Discretized the probability into binary code, and evaluated the accuracy of the logistic regression model
