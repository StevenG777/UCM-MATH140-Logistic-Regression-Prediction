# UCM-MATH140-Logistic-Regression-Prediction

## Descriptions
I used this project as a practice project to build everything from scratch to develop a logistic regression model. The project advanced my comprehensive understanding of underlying principle of optimization method and statistical analysis method, and honed my coding skills in Matlab

## Project Details
- Based on the objective function including logistic regression model and regularization, derived its gradient and hessian
- Applied Gradient Descent and Newton's Method to optimize the parameter of objective function in order to minimize the objective function's value
- Substituted the computed parameters back to the logistic regression model and obtain probability as output
- Discretized the probability into binary code, and evaluate the accuracy of logistic regression model
